### Hello 👋

My name is Krish Desai. A 14 year old coder, entrepreneur and thinker. I am currently learning and expanding my skillset in both Java and HTML/CSS. Enjoy a tour of my profile! You might see something cool 😎 

🔭 I am currently working on two things; expanding my development based organization called World of Devs (check it on instagram at @theworldofdevs) and launching my first ever startup (took me long enough 😓 )
